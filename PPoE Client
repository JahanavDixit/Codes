One open-source PPPoE client that you can use is rp-pppoe. This is a client for the PPP over Ethernet protocol, which is used by many DSL providers.

The rp-pppoe client is a user-space program that can be run on Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, and can be configured using a simple configuration file.

Here is an example of how you can install and configure rp-pppoe on a Linux machine:

Copy code
# Install rp-pppoe
sudo apt-get install rp-pppoe

# Create a configuration file for rp-pppoe
sudo nano /etc/ppp/peers/dsl-provider
Copy code
# Configuration file for rp-pppoe
user "your_username"
password "your_password"
Copy code
# Connect to the PPPoE server
sudo pppd call dsl-provider
You can also specify the Ethernet interface to use with the eth option in the configuration file.

Copy code
# Configuration file for rp-pppoe
user "your_username"
password "your_password"
eth0
You can use the command ifconfig to check the status of the PPPoE connection, it should show up as ppp0 or similar.

You can also use this script to automate the connection process on boot.

Please be aware that this is just one example, there are other open-source PPPoE clients available such as "ppp" and "pppoeconf" that you can use.
You should also be aware that this script has not been tested and may require additional modifications to work on your specific system
